<p> Problem: <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/372/B">Counting Rectangles is Fun!</a> </p> 

<p> <b> Problem statement </b> Given a boolean matrix and sub-matrix queries. A "good" sub matrix is one which has all 0s. For each query, find how many good sub matrix it contains? </p>

<p> My intial guess looking at the problem was may be this could be a 2D segment tree problem. Also because I struggled with <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html#simple-2d-segment-tree">understanding 2D range queries recently.</a>	

After trying for sometime, I gave up on the segment tree idea and shifted to think in lines of prefix sum. I came up with a idea similar to technique-4 discussed in the blog. The reason to keep this last is because I learnt some really cool techniques going over the <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/372/status/B">AC solutions</a> which can be used to solve this problem and I wanted to show them first. 

<li><b>Technique-1(Foreward DP)</b>: Check tourist's <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/372/submission/5421838"> solution </a> 

</br></br>

 <p> Technique 1 is the major motivation behind the post. This solution by tourist did not seem easy to understand. All the 4 nested loops repeated 4 times seemed cryptic to me for quite a long time. I started to gain some insights by treating them as foreward DP transformations. It has a pretty geometrical idea that a "good" rectangle is only added to all the "covering" rectangles after 4 stages of iteration. I tried to animate the covering rectangle concept and the transformation ideas in a 3b1b style animation video below.

<li><b>Technique-2(DP sets DP+Inclusion/Exclusion)</b></br> </br>

<p> Basic idea of this approach is to calculate the query in two steps. In first step, $dp_1[i][j][k][l]$ counts all good rectangles in $rect(i,j,k,l)$ with top-left corner $(i,k)$ fixed and bottom right corner $(x,y)$ such that $x<=k \space\&\space y<=l$. In the second iteration, use $dp_2$ to find all good rectangles which end at (x,y) such that $x<=k \space\&\space y<=l$ and start after $(i,k)$. $dp_1$ is needed by $dp_2$ to find the unknown set i.e all good rectangles starting at $(i,k)$ ending anywhere before $(j,l)$.

<li><b>Technique-3 (Inclusion-Exclusion DP) </b>
<p>
Idea: Use inclusion exclusion to find the answer to $dp(i,j,k,l)=dp(i+1,j,k,l) \cup dp(i,j-1,k,l) \cup dp(i,j,k+1,l) \cup dp(i,j,k,l-1)$. </br>

<li><b>Technique-4 (Prefix Sum DP)</b>

<p>Idea behind this is simple. Calculate $dp(i,j,k,l)$ using $dp(i,j,k-1,l) \cup dp(i,j,k,l-1)$ and calculate all those good rectangles that end its right corner in $(j,l)$. Calculating the last part becomes easy if we calculate all the zero-towers (col-wise) from a particular cell.
